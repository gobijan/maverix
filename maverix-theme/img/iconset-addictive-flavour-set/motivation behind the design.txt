Motivation behind the design
-----------------------------


In january 2009 I released my first pixel-based iconset 'flavour' right here on the Smashing Magazine and a few month later in may 2009 I extended that set and released 'flavour extended'.

Now, over one year later it's time to finish this set.
'Addictive flavour' will be the last part of the flavour series. (At least for now I think it will be ^_^ )

In my last releases I asked you for your feedback on the iconset and that feedback was overwhelming. I received hundreds of emails and read even more comments here and on twitter (http://twitter.com/mywayhome).

With 'addictive flavour' I hope to give you the iconset that you wanted and that you need for your web development projects.
Though, if there is a special icon missing in the set that you need for your project or site:
Please feel free to contact me at twitter (http://twitter.com/mywayhome) or via email (icons@addictedotocoffee.de) and we'll see what we can do for you!

I want to thank all of you for your great support with this huge iconset. Especially I want to thank Magda, Lars, Martin LeBlanc, Bastian Allgeier, the team at Smashing Magazine and all of the beta-viewers who did a fantastic job on reviewing my work and giving me feedback, love and inspiration!

Please stay tuned for more of my releases here in Smashing Magazine or via my twitter stream (http://twitter.com/mywayhome).

Thanks a lot, Oliver
